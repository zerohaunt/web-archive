~~Once deployed, please login as soon as possible, the first user to login will be set as the administrator.~~

## Command Deploy

Requirements: Local installation of node environment.  
Command deployment is more troublesome to update, so it is recommended to use Github Actions deployment.  

### 0. Download the code
Download the latest service.zip from the release page, unzip it, and execute the following commands in the root directory.

### 1. Login
```bash
npx wrangler login
```

### 2. Create R2 storage bucket
```bash
npx wrangler r2 bucket create web-archive
```

Success output:
```bash
 ⛅️ wrangler 3.78.10 (update available 3.80.4)
--------------------------------------------------------

Creating bucket web-archive with default storage class set to Standard.
Created bucket web-archive with default storage class set to Standard.
```

### 3. Create D1 database
```bash
npx wrangler d1 create web-archive
```

Success output:
```bash
✅ Successfully created DB 'web-archive' in region UNKNOWN
Created your new D1 database.

[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB" # i.e. available in your Worker on env.DB
database_name = "web-archive"
database_id = "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
```

Copy the last line of the output, replace the `database_id` value in the `wrangler.toml` file.

Then execute the following command to initialize the database:
```bash
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply web-archive --remote
```

Success output:
```bash
🌀 Executing on remote database web-archive (7fd5a5ce-79e7-4519-a5fb-2f9a3af71064):
🌀 To execute on your local development database, remove the --remote flag from your wrangler command.
Note: if the execution fails to complete, your DB will return to its original state and you can safely retry.

## How to update

Use Github Actions deployment, the latest code will be automatically synced to the fork repository.

Command deployment needs to download the latest code and update manually.
